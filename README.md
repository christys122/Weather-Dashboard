# Weather-Dashboard

The Weather-Dashboard is designed to allow the user to enter a city and return the current weather data.  It also displays the forecast for the next 5 days.  This allows the user to confirm or adjust their plans based on the results.

## Features

When you enter the city, the main section reflects the chosen city, date, time and icon representing the current weather.  You are also presented with other important information such as the uv index for the day.  
In the next section you find the same weather information for the same city for the next 5 days.
Under the search section the local storage saves your last search so you can click rather than re-type the city.

## Issue/Bugs

The date also returns the time - this will be fixed in a future update as it is not visually appealing. 
The search history does return multiple searches, this will also be fixed in a future update to allow the user to search and retain multiple cities.
Due to the help found online and my associates and peers, bugs have been held to a minimium for this project producing a well functioning website.

## Lessons Learned

This project allowed me to strenthed my knowledge of web apis.  Referring to the documentation throughout the process times allowed me to locate and correct issues. I was also able to practice using several connected sources such as Bootstrap, Jquery, and the Open Weather Map api to return the weather data.
